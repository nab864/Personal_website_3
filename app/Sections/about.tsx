      <h2>
        Welcome to my personal website! I am currently working as a chemistry
        researcher, where I explore the complexities of chemical interactions
        and contribute to advancements in the field of lithium ion batteries.
        Alongside my passion for science, I am excited to embark on a new
        journey into software development, combining my analytical mindset and
        problem-solving skills with the world of technology. This site will
        showcase my work, experiences, and the evolving journey of bridging my
        expertise in chemistry with the innovative possibilities of software
        development. Thank you for visiting!

        In addition to my research background, I have developed a strong
        proficiency in Python and JavaScript. My work with Python includes data
        analysis, automation, and scripting, while my JavaScript skills are
        centered around web development. I have a solid understanding of
        building dynamic and responsive websites using React, bringing
        interactivity and efficiency to the forefront of user experiences. These
        programming skills are a key part of my transition into software
        development.
